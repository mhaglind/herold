# Herold 🏰
## AI-Powered Family Tree Web Application

**Transform family stories into beautiful family trees through natural language.**

Herold is a revolutionary web application that lets you create and manage complex family trees by simply describing relationships in natural language. Say "Halvard's father is Holmfast" and watch as AI automatically updates your family data and regenerates a beautiful visual family tree.

## 🌟 Vision

**From hours of manual editing to seconds of natural conversation.**

Traditional family tree software requires tedious form-filling and manual positioning. Herold uses AI to understand natural language descriptions of family relationships and automatically generates publication-quality family trees with sophisticated layout algorithms.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 Natural Language Processing**: "Add Elanor as Galrandir's daughter and Halli's wife"
- **🎨 Automatic Layout Generation**: Professional family tree diagrams generated instantly
- **📱 Multi-Project Management**: Manage multiple family lineages and genealogies
- **🎭 Cultural Intelligence**: Supports different naming traditions (Nordic, Elvish, English, etc.)
- **🖋️ Beautiful Typography**: Multiple script fonts and elegant styling options
- **📄 Multiple Formats**: Portrait/landscape, various export formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- **⚡ Real-time Updates**: See your family tree update as you type

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

```
Frontend:  React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
Backend:   Node.js + Express + TypeScript
AI:        Claude API (Anthropic)

```

## 📁 Project Status

**Current Phase: Design & Planning**

This repository contains:
1. **🎯 Implementation Plan**: Complete technical specification (`HEROLD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
2. **📊 Reference Data**: Halling family tree as test case and quality benchmark
3. **🧮 Algorithm Research**: Manual SVG layout work that informs automated algorithms
4. **📋 Documentation**: Comprehensive development roadmap

## 🚀 Quick Start (Planned)

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/herold.git
cd herold
npm install

# Start development environment
npm run dev  # Backend on :3001, Frontend on :3000

# Create your first family tree
# Navigate to localhost:3000
# Type: "Create new project called 'My Family'"
# Then: "Add John as the father of Mary"
# Watch the magic happen! ✨
```

## 🧮 Core Technical Challenges

### 1. Automatic Layout Generation
Converting manual family tree design expertise into algorithmic form:
- **Position Optimization**: Mathematical algorithms for optimal person placement
- **Collision Detection**: Preventing overlapping names and crossing lines
- **Family Group Routing**: Intelligent connection lines between related individuals
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Layout adjustments for different naming traditions

### 2. Natural Language Understanding
Transforming conversational input into precise data operations:
- **Relationship Extraction**: Understanding "father", "daughter", "married to", etc.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Handling incomplete or unclear relationship descriptions
- **Context Awareness**: Maintaining family context across multiple statements
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of AI misunderstandings

### 3. Visual Quality Assurance
Ensuring generated family trees meet publication standards:
- **Typography Excellence**: Multiple font options with proper spacing
- **Layout Aesthetics**: Balanced composition and visual hierarchy
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Appropriate styling for different traditions
- **Export Quality**: High-resolution output for printing and sharing

## 📊 Reference Implementation

The **Halling Family** tree serves as our development benchmark:

- **22 family members** across **8 generations**
- **4 cultural traditions**: Nordic, Elvish (Sindarin), English (Bri-folk), Geographic
- **Complex relationships**: Multiple marriages, adoption, cultural mixing
- **Manual SVG perfection**: Hand-crafted layout serving as quality target

This real-world complexity ensures our algorithms can handle sophisticated genealogies.

## 🎭 Cultural Intelligence

Herold understands different naming and family traditions:

### Nordic Tradition (Dale-folk)
- **Names**: Hafgrim, Steinþór, Bjornulf
- **Patterns**: Patronymic suffixes, nature-related meanings
- **Layout**: Emphasis on warrior lineages and territorial connections

### Elvish Tradition (Sindarin)
- **Names**: Galrandir, Mithrellas, Beregond
- **Patterns**: Elegant compound meanings, house affiliations
- **Layout**: Refined typography and hierarchical presentation

### English Tradition (Bri-folk)
- **Names**: Rosanna Hede, Aldred Hede
- **Patterns**: Practical surnames, geographic identifiers
- **Layout**: Compact family units with clear relationships

## 🔮 Future Vision

Herold aims to become the definitive platform for family history:

- **📚 Family Chronicles**: Rich storytelling alongside genealogy
- **🛡️ Heraldry Integration**: Coat of arms and family symbols
- **🧬 DNA Integration**: Connecting genetic data with family stories
- **🌍 Historical Context**: Timeline integration and historical events
- **👥 Collaborative Editing**: Multiple family members contributing
- **📱 Mobile Apps**: Native iOS and Android applications

## 📋 Documentation

- **[Implementation Plan](HEROLD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**: Complete technical specification
